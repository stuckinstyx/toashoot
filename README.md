Very early work on extracting FB Neo roms from the Toplan shooters on steam.

Copy the executable from steam into a temporary folder and run binwalk -e on it.

Then run the appropriate shell script.

Should work in Linux or WSL.

Use at your own risk, these are very basic scripts with no error checking or any good programming practices.
